## Introduction

Discounts allow for the reduction of prices for selected variants, products, collections,
or categories by a given percentage or a fixed value.
There are two kinds of discounts in Saleor: `Sales` and `Vouchers`.
The **sale** discount is automatically applied to all products included in the sale, without requiring
any additional actions from the user. In contrast, **vouchers** require the user to provide
a code during the checkout process. Both the sale and voucher discounts can be used together.
